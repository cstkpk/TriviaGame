# Trivia Game

* The Trivia Game is a JavaScript game where you try to select the correct answer for a given question. For every correct answer you add a point to your wins, and for every incorrect answer you add a point to your losses, but watch out for the timer! If you don't answer a question before the timer runs down, it will be marked as unanswered. You get 30 seconds for each question, and at the end, you find out your total score.
